story:
Your name is Bob the square and you are lost in the 4'th dimention,
you are trying to get home and trying to find the
right flag to bring you home(yea the flag is a portal to another dimention)
good luck!

how to play:
so its basicly normal platformer but when you dash you jump also and its more intresting and fun but simple

if you dont understand that then that is what platformer + new stuff that i added its very simple

normal keys for moement wad or keys
and attack and dash at the same time is space and thats what makes the game more fun
you have 3 lives
the enemies got 3 lives
if u hit an enemy you lose 1 life
if the enemy hits you 1 time you lose 1 life and the enemy being destroyed
if you touch the enemy projectile or lava you die
you can destory the enemy projectile with your bullets and the bullet wouldn't be destroyed
you need to catch 3 stars to make the green flag usable and visable,
and if you want to go to the next level you need to touch the green flag
there are some little stuff that you will learn alone and its doesnt matter to the game
